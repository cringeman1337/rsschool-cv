### About me

My goal and priorities are yet to be determined,  
since i have just graduated from 9th grade, yet the  
best case csenario is eventually becoming a frontend  
developer (plan B is being a plumber).\

### My skills

- Some experience with Python
- Unsubstantial knowledge of C++ and OpenGL
- Considerable experince in React/JS

### Code example

Literally first Codewars task:

```
#include <string>
bool solution(std::string const &STRING, std::string const &END) {
  if (END.length() > STRING.length())
    {
    return false;
  }
  if (STRING.substr(STRING.length() - END.length(), STRING.length()) == END)
    {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

### Work experience

Kinda zero :P

### Education

I have just graduated from 9th grade

### English proficiency
